# Web-Based Ngram Viewer

This project involves building a web-based Ngram viewer to visualize and analyze Ngram data. The application leverages different data structures like `TreeMap`, `HashMap`, and focuses on system-level file reading techniques to efficiently process and display Ngram frequencies.

## Key Features

- **Web-Based Interface**: Allows users to interact with and visualize Ngram data in a user-friendly format.
- **Data Structures Utilized**:
  - **TreeMap**: Used for storing sorted key-value pairs and supporting efficient range queries.
  - **HashMap**: Used for fast lookups and storage of Ngram frequencies.
- **System File Handling**: Implements techniques for reading and processing system files to extract and manipulate Ngram data.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: For implementing the backend, utilizing TreeMap and HashMap.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java backend server.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to interact with the Ngram viewer.
